Folder contains an assortment of schemes, tests, factoring algorithms, and other related cryptographic
tools and concepts implemented as simple Python scripts meant to run on any Python IDE (I used Spyder).  
Below are the contents of the folders, along with a brief descrition of each script.  For more details, 
please see comments in .py files:

CompositenessTests
	MillerRabin: implementation of the Miller-Rabin compositeness test, using nested for loops

FactoringAlgorithms
	PollardP1: implementation of the Pollard-P1 factoring algorithm


More To Come:
	RSA Public Key Scheme
	Schnorr Scheme
	Pollard Rho Algorithm
	Soloway-Straussen Test
	Dixon's Random Squares
	Diffee-Hellman Key Exchange
	Elgamal Scheme
	Index Calculus Algorithm
	Rohlig-Hellmen Algorithm
	RSA Digital Signitures and Forgergies
	Remote Card Playing Game
	RSA Blind Signitures

All code written is an entirely original implementation.  Please feel free to use any of them if they can help
you in any way.
